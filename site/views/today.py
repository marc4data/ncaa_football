"""Today — Looking Back. The weekly recap.

Front of house only. No pipeline, dbt, freshness or DQ content appears here (AC-1.7) — that
is System Overview's job, back of house.

WHAT THIS PAGE STOPPED BEING (R-428). It used to render an srv_game slate table, which
duplicated Schedule and answered a question Schedule answers better. The slate is not lost:
the link below routes to it. Today is now a recap of a COMPLETED week, and Looking Forward —
the week preview — is a later round and says so rather than showing an empty frame.

EVERY PANEL READS ONE SERVING VIEW AND DOES NO ARITHMETIC. The recap lists rank on columns
that already exist (`spread_favorite_side`, `moneyline_favorite_side`, `actual_margin`,
`favorite_covered`); the leaderboards order by a stored `stat_value`. Deriving a favorite or
a cover in Streamlit would be metric maths in the app, which is the rule those columns exist
to keep.

# ⚠️ R-583. `DATASETS` MOVED TO `lib/datasets.py` AND IS IMPORTED, NOT DEFINED HERE.
#
# It was declared in this file by A089 and Matchup needs the same labels. Two tables naming
# the same views — `srv_game` and `srv_team_week` are read by both pages — would disagree, and
# preventing exactly that disagreement is what A089's design was for. The labels, the keys and
# the wording are unchanged by the lift; the module's own header carries the reasoning.

# (slug, label, panel names). THE SLUG IS WHAT GOES IN THE URL.
#
# ⚠️ ANCHORS, NOT `st.tabs`, AND R-283 IS WHY. Marc: "Clicking a sort while on Against The
# Line or Box Score resets the user to the Game Results tab." st.tabs keeps its selection
# client-side and never touches the URL, so every sort link rebuilds the page at the default
# tab. scores.py solved this first and B075 reused it for Matchup; this is the third page on
# the same pattern.
#
# ⚠️ AND ANCHORS ARE LAZY, WHICH ON THIS PAGE IS THE POINT RATHER THAN A SIDE EFFECT. Only
# the active tab's panels are called, so a reader who came to look forward does not pay for
# five backward panels' queries.
#
# Panels are NAMED rather than referenced so the laziness is testable: body() resolves each
# name out of the module at call time, and test_today_tabs.py asserts every name resolves to
# the real function rather than to a recorder.

    ⚠️ THE DEFENSE AXIS RUNS THE OTHER WAY, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN DECISION.
    Low yards allowed is GOOD. Plotted the obvious way — value increasing upward, as a reader
    trained on cartesian axes expects — the best defenses land at the bottom and the chart
    reads backwards to anyone scanning for "up and right is good", which is how everyone scans
    a scatter before reading a word of it.
    So yards allowed increases DOWNWARD: the strongest defenses are at the TOP, the strongest
    offenses at the RIGHT, and the top-right corner is unambiguously the good one. In SVG this
    needs no flip — y already grows downward — which is precisely why it is easy to ship the
    wrong orientation without noticing you chose one.

    An axis label alone would not carry this, so the direction is stated three ways: arrows on
    both axis titles, the words "better" on each, and a corner marker. No colour scale, no
    threshold line, no quadrant shading — none of those judgements has been made.

# ⚠️ R-562. THE ONLY ALTAIR IN THE SITE, AND IT IS NOT A NEW DEPENDENCY.
# `altair` is a HARD REQUIREMENT of streamlit — `pip show streamlit` lists it first — so it is
# already in the image and importing it adds no package. It is declared in
# site/requirements.txt anyway, because a direct import deserves a direct declaration: relying
# on a transitive pin means the day streamlit drops altair this page raises on import, and
# that file's own header says the failure mode for a missing site dependency is silent.
#
# WHY NOT st.line_chart. It cannot do the one thing a bump chart requires. Measured on the
# pinned streamlit 1.61.1: the call accepts only
# `data, x, y, x_label, y_label, color, width, height, use_container_width` — no scale, no
# domain, no reverse — and the Vega-Lite it generates encodes y as
# `{"type": "quantitative", "scale": {}}`. An empty scale on a quantitative axis ascends
# upward, so RANK 1 PLOTTED AT THE BOTTOM. The caption that used to sit under it said "Rank 1
# at the top of the axis is inverted by convention", which was false in both halves: the axis
# was not inverted and nothing in that call could invert it.
#
# WHY NOT HAND-DRAWN SVG, which this file has a precedent for in _scatter_svg. The only hard
# requirement here is an inverted ordinal axis, and `alt.Scale(reverse=True)` is that in three
# words. `st.line_chart`'s own docstring calls itself "syntax-sugar around st.altair_chart",
# so this removes the sugar rather than adding a layer.

    # 🚨 R-558. ATTRIBUTION ATTACHES TO RENDERED MODEL OUTPUT, AND THIS PAGE RENDERS NONE.

    # ⚠️ WHOEVER ADDS A `predicted_*` COLUMN TO THIS PAGE ADDS THE CALL BACK WITH IT:
    #
    #     attribution.model_attribution(_completed_games(scope))
    #
    # `attribution` IS STILL SELECTED in _completed_games on purpose, so that is a one-line
    # change rather than two. §0.9's design is that a page cannot render the model's numbers
    # without having fetched the string saying whose model it is; keeping the column fetched
    # keeps that guarantee ready rather than making the next person rediscover it.
    #
    # This page is EXPECTED to gain model numbers — MODEL_WEEK_FLOOR and _recap_lists'
    # "model-derived framing is withheld before week N" both anticipate it.
    #
    # WHY IT CAME OUT (R-558, tracing back to R-545). A083 fixed a false claim here:
    # `attribution` had been on srv_game all along and this query was the only one not
    # asking for it, so model_attribution() took
    # its "column missing from this view — this is a defect (AC-G.41)" branch and printed
    # that on the landing page. Correct, and it left a true statement that was still noise —
    # on the current season the page said "attribution is null on every row", a warning about
    # the absence of provenance for predictions it never showed.
    #
    # ⚠️ TODAY DOES RENDER PROBABILITIES, AND THEY ARE NOT OURS. `market_implied_*` is the
    # BOOK's number and the prefix is itself the provenance (§4.3 — "a licence boundary
    # wearing a naming convention"). `largest_single_play_swing` and
    # `home_win_probability_range` are CFBD play-by-play derivatives and are selected but
    # never rendered. There is no `predicted_*` anywhere in this module.


def render() -> None:
